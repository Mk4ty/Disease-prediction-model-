# Disease-prediction-model-
The project builds a machine learning model to predict diseases based on symptoms using Naive Bayes and KNN. After preprocessing and encoding data, models are trained and evaluated. This system aids in early diagnosis and can be enhanced with better models or a user-friendly interface.
